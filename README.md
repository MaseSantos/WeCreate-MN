<img src="images/Landing_Page_View.gif" alt="WeCreate MN Landing Page View" width="50%" />

WeCreate MN is a web-based application that serves as a job board and candidate database for prospective creatives of color in Minnesota. In the Midwest as a whole, the creative industry has a low hiring and retention rate for people of color. WeCreate MN serves to showcase job opportunities by organizations interested in accessing a more-inclusive applicant pool, while also highlighting creatives of color in various practices. Individuals seeking opportunities will be able to create their own profile through a “Personal” portal, including links to outside portfolios. Organizations will be able to submit job opportunities via an “Employer” portal, and then have their jobs posted to a searchable online database.
